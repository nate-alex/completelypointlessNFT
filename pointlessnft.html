    <h1><b> This is a completely pointless NFT. </b></h1>
    <h3> Well, at least it was when it was originally conceptualized. It all started with a <a href="https://twitter.com/mewn21/status/1434314480582893569?s=20" target="_blank">mewny tweet</a>
     talking about an NFT that was just the holder's public key on a black background. I spent about 30 minutes coding it up and adding a few pointless features including the count of each letter and number in the address, and a "decay" state which changes the background color slightly upon each transfer. One final quirk is that the NFT changes to show whichever address it currently resides in. Metadata may need to be refreshed on opensea for it to update quickly.</h3>
    <h3> It was initially intended to be a meme, just something I coded out of boredom, and pricing was set to 0.042069 with the maximum cap set to 969. Shortly after release, I decided I would donate all the money from the primary sales to a charity (the actual charity is still TBD). I will link the tx hash of the donation here when it is complete. Maybe this project isn't completely pointless now.</h3>
